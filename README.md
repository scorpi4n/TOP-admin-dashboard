# admin-dashboard

This project was originally just assigned by TOP to get used to creating page layouts with css grid and css flexbox but I've decided to flesh the page out as much as possible. It won't be fully functional but I think I can at least make all the links functional and style the site in a manner that I like.

I'll likely make a branch to submit to TOP as a solution but I plan on updating the site to work on my HTML, CSS, and (maybe) JavaScript skills. At the present moment I have no plans to implement a backend but we'll see if that changes.
